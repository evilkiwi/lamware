# Contributing to OYED Open Source

I aim to give back to the Developer communities I engage in as often as possible - as such, I maintain various Open
Source libraries and software, both related to my own library ecosystem and otherwise.

I'm always welcome to feedback, PRs and constructive criticism of my software.

## Code of Conduct

I employ the [Contributor Covenant 2.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/)
Code of Conduct for my Open Source libraries. By submitting PRs, Issues or contributing towards my software
in any other means, you agree to follow the conduct laid out.

Please let me know [via Discord](https://discord.gg/3S6AKZ2GR9) if you feel someone is not doing so.

## I have a question!

Do not use the Issues section to ask questions regarding my Open Source software - instead, if you feel
comfortable using Discord, [join mine](https://discord.gg/3S6AKZ2GR9) and ask any questions you may have in
the `#oss-support` channel.

## I've found an issue with the library/software

In this case, feel free to open a [Bug Report](https://github.com/oyed/devon/issues/new) and fully explain
the Issue to me. If you don't explain in enough detail, it makes it much harder to diagnose.

Ideally I'd love a minimal set-up that reproduces the issue as well, but it isn't required.

## I have a PR which fixes a bug/adds a new feature

Great! I'd love to see it!

- Open a PR against this repository
- Explain in detail what the PR does and why you are submitting it
- Add any additional info
  - For example, if this is a new feature, provide your fork with a working example

## Final notes

Thank you for considering contributing to my Open Source software - I do my best to work on and maintain anything
I feel would benefit the software, as well as requests from the community. Contributions are a great way to give
back!
